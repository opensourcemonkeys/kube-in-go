 * app, and the CSP would refuse anyway).
 *
 * This lives in its own module — rather than in `main.tsx`, where it used to —
 * because importing `monaco-editor` is what pulls Monaco into whatever chunk
 * does the importing. From the entry point that meant every launch parsed all
 * of Monaco before painting anything, even for a session that never opens a
 * YAML tab. Every Monaco-using panel imports this module and every one of them
 * is `React.lazy`, so Monaco now arrives with the first editor that needs it.
 *
 * Import for side effects: `import '../../lib/monacoBootstrap';`. Module
 * evaluation happens once, so repeated imports are free.
