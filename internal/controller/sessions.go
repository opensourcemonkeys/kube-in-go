// `defer delete(m, key)` — deletes whatever is under the key by the time the
// job finishes, which after a restart is the *replacement* job's entry. The job
// then runs unregistered: nothing can cancel it, and anything that looks the
// session up finds nothing. That is what left AI chat hanging forever on the
// tool-approval dialog when a second turn was started before the first ended —
// ConfirmToolCall could not find the session, so the agent loop stayed parked
// on its channel until the context died.
